Join [t.me/moneysocket](https://t.me/moneysocket) on Telegram as a gathering point for discussion.

There is a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqE3dWTuqRc8p8C3O_zlbrkYuGENCaVqp) with screencasts and discussions. The first video is a demo of the proof-of-concept.

The branch of the running code used in the first proof-of-concept video is in the branch called `proof-of-concept`.

Is this better than LNURL?
===========
No. It is different for different use cases. Perhaps it is a good idea to combine any such websocket spec under the scope of [LNURL](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc), but only if that makes sense to stakeholders.
